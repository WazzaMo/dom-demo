# DOM Demo

An interactive DOM Demo.

[Try it Out](https://wazzamo.github.io/dom-demo/demo/)

Features:
- Demonstration Formatted Output
- Demonstration HTML source
- Sample DOM Snippets that demonstrate use cases
- The snippets are interactive, with source that updates as parameters are set
- An "Apply" button to see the affect of the snippet.

The code behind this demo was written with
regular HTML, modern CSS and fairly
unassuming JavaScript.

A utility class called fluid-dom.js was
written that made it easier to manipulate
the DOM in a functional way. Kind of like
LINQ for JS & DOM.
